## Technical Interviewing Workshop Extravaganza

---

## What we'll cover

- Strategies for answering code questions
- HackerRank style questions
- Frontend code questions
- Behavioural questions
- Interview preparation plan!

---

## Familiarity with the problem is your most valuable asset

<Notes>
  - Think about a test that you've taken in the past that you did well on. - Ask
  yourself, why did I do well? The answer was likely preparation, you had a
  syllabus, expectations of the subject matter being covered, and you spent time
  on focussed studying. - Now think about interviews, it's essentially a test
  but you have limited to no information for how to prepare. How is anyone
  supposed to do a good job??? - Let's try to maximize familiarity with
  problems, while also not driving ourselves bananas.
</Notes>

---

## Common areas covered with interviews

- HackerRank / Codility style questions
- Building parts of frontend functionality
- Frontend general knowledge
- Behavioural questions

<Notes>
  - We can do our best to prep for these areas without covering absolutely
  everything. - The goal here is to cover enough ground that things are fresh in
  our minds so that even if we see a problem that's new, we can derive a
  solution from a previous experience
</Notes>

---

## HackerRank / Codility style questions

- First of all, ugh
- Step one: make sure we understand the problem, write out inputs and outputs
- Step two: write out the logic required to get to the output in milestones
- Step three: work through each milestone in code, set up a good way to verify
- Step four: do enough of these problems that you get used to them

<Notes>
  - For most people, these questions are the most daunting because we don't
  really work this way as developers. - The main strategy here is to solve lots
  of these problems so our brains can get used to thinking that way
</Notes>

## Example Time!

Let's go through an example of solving a question. We'll be solving the [Repeated String](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/repeated-string/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup) problem.

---

## Step one: understand the problem

Inputs

- `s`: a string that will be repeated to infinity (e.g. `aba`)
- `n`: a number, the first `n` letters of the infinite string

Outputs:

- `s = 'aba'`, `n = 10`
- first 10 letters of string: `abaabaabaa`
- answer (total number of a's): 7

<Notes>
  - Go through the process of manually writing out thinking about inputs/outputs
  even if they are given to you - This makes you go through the process of
  solving the problem for one case, which brings us to the next step: logic
</Notes>

---

## Step two: write out logic

- Count the number of a's in `s`
- Find the number of times the complete string would appear in the section of the infinite string & the remainder string
- Answer is the `a count` times the number of times the whole string would appear `+` the number of a's in the remainder string

<Notes>
  - As much as possible, we want to avoid writing code and solving the logic
  puzzle at the same time - Start thinking about the logic puzzle first.
</Notes>

---

## Step 3: write code based on each milestone

- Count the number of a's in `s`

```javascript
const repeatedString = (s, n) => {
  // filter string for # of a's
  const numberOfAsInSubstring = s.split("").filter((e) => e === "a").length;

  return numberOfAsInSubstring;
};

repeatedString("aba", 10); // expect 2
```

---

## Step 3: write code based on each milestone

- Find the number of times the complete string would appear in the section of the infinite string & the remainder

```javascript
const repeatedString = (s, n) => {
  // filter string for # of a's
  const numberOfAsInSubstring = s.split("").filter((e) => e === "a").length;

  // number of times complete substring appears in string
  const numberOfCompleteStrings = Math.floor(n / s.length);
  // number of letters leftover
  const leftoverStringLength = n % s.length;

  return [numberOfCompleteStrings, leftoverStringLength];
};

repeatedString("aba", 10); // expect [3, 1]
```

---

## Step 3: write code based on each milestone

- Answer is the a count times the number of times the whole string would appear + the number of a's in the remainder string

```javascript
const repeatedString = (s, n) => {
  // filter string for # of a's
  const numberOfAsInSubstring = s.split("").filter((e) => e === "a").length;

  // number of times complete substring appears in string
  const numberOfCompleteStrings = Math.floor(n / s.length);
  // number of letters leftover
  const leftoverStringLength = n % s.length;

  // leftover string count
  const leftoverStringACount = s
    .substring(0, leftoverStringLength)
    .split("")
    .filter((e) => e === "").length;

  return numberOfAsInSubstring * numberOfCompleteStrings + leftoverStringACount;
};

repeatedString("aba", 10); // expect 7
```

<Notes>
  - Advantage of doing it this way is you are validating the pieces of complex
  logic as you go - shouldnt have to go back and console log a bunch
</Notes>

## Frontend Code Questions

Most companies will either have you do a React question OR complete a task in the framework of your choice.

Things to build to keep things fresh in your mind:

- Typeahead using vanilla JavaScript
- Todo app with React (add todos, complete them, show how many are remaining)
- Make an API call and display a list of items, click into the item to display more info

---

## Frontend Code Questions

Some advanced things to build (optional):

- Autocomplete component that pulls from an API
- Input masking component (e.g. phone numbers)
- Counter with React Context

---

## Frontend General knowledge

Stuff to have an informed opinion about (think about your past experience and draw on it)

- CSS framework preferences / preferred way to organize CSS in a project
- Unit testing strategies
- Performance considerations
- A11y
- State management

---

## Behavioural Questions

Come up with examples for the following:

- A time you received difficult feedback
- A time you had to give someone difficult feedback
- A project you're really proud of
- A project that was hard and had lots of issues
- Personal learning or growth
- A time you demonstrated a care for users

---

## Format for answering behavioural questions

- Present the situation clearly + provide context
- Reflect on what you would have done differently
- Reflect on what you learned from that experience

[A good resource to fill out](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_soft_skills_-_v6.pdf)

## A note on mental health & resiliency

- Interviews are a mentally gruelling process to go through
- Things are already hard right now because of the pandemic
- It is extremely important to care for yourself

## What can we do to make things easier?

- Find a group of people you can talk to and that can support you through this time
- Is there someone that can help you with regular life things while you're interviewing?
- Write down some things that bring you joy and _make time for them_
- Don't overload yourself with volume of interviews

---

## Interview preparation plan

- Practice HackerRank questions
- Build a few common frontend features to keep things fresh in your mind
- Write down your opinions based on your experience to some "general knowledge" questions
- Reflect on your experiences to fill out your behavioural questions worksheet
- Make a self care plan
